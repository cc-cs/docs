\section{Introduction}
\label{sec-1}

This document enumerates key agenda items for Spring 2016 semester for the
Columbia College Computer Science Club. In particular, a rough outline of
planned events is included. More information on the events will be provided as
we approach them but the club hopes that we will generate interest based on the
preliminary information here. Any volunteers are greatly encouraged to
participate in any activity of interest to them.

Please send an email to the CS club officers at cccsofficers@googlegroups.com
if you are interested in any information discussed in this document or have any
other comments pertinent to the club.

\section{Columbia College Computer Science Club}
\label{sec-2}

\subsection{Google Group}
\label{sec-2-1}

The CS department has a Google Group that is used as our mailing list. The
group is cc\_cs and the mailing address for the group is cc\_cs@googlegroups.com.
In particular, it is used for department-wide announcments that include club
events and employment opportunities. If you know someone who should be in the
group but isn't (happens a lot with new CS students), please send them our way.

\subsection{Calendar}
\label{sec-2-2}

There's a calendar of events that you can access through the frontpage at
\url{http://bit.ly/yliow0}.

\end{description}
\end{description}

\newpage

\subsection{Computer Science Hangouts}
\label{sec-2-4}

We meet every day from 3 to 5 pm in one of the Buchanan labs.

There are seniors and Dr. Liow in attendance who will help with anything CS
related. Everyone's encouraged to help each other where possible as well.

It's fine to come just to hang out if no help is needed for classwork. It's
also fine to come discuss CS related topics outside of classwork.

The exact room schedule is posted on the calendar, but we are in BUH104 on
Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and in BUH107 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. There
are a couple of days where both those rooms were occupied for something else
and we will be in some other BUH room for those days. Just look around the
Buchanan rooms between 3 to 5 pm and we will be in one of them.

\begin{description}
\item[{WHAT:}] Computer Science Hangouts
\item[{WHY:}] Hangout with others in the department and get help if you need any
\item[{WHEN:}] 3pm to 5 pm, every weekday
\item[{WHERE:}] Buchanan Hall, BUH104 or BUH107, just check the rooms
\end{description}

\newpage

\subsection{Club Meetings}
\label{sec-2-5}

The club will have meetings on demand. We have events planned throughout the
semester that we will send periodic information about as we approach them
through the Google Group and other channels. We also treat Computer Science
Hangout sessions every Friday from 3 to 5 pm in BUH104 as informal club
meetings. Club members should make every attempt to join the Friday hangout
sessions if possible.

Apart from the regular club things you can expect of a typical
college club, you can expect to learn valuable information through occasional
events such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item workshops on various tools that a programmer should be aware of
\item talks on career planning, searching for internships and jobs, interview
preparation and so on
\item forums on various special interest topics such as game development,
artificial intelligence and more
\item presentations from students who want to show off their work
\end{itemize}

If there's an event such as these scheduled, we will notify the group and the
club will have an official meeting. Most of these will be scheduled during the
Friday hangout sessions but we will consider organizing events with heavy
demand at other times as well.

We will typically ask for volunteers to produce content for and/or run the next
meeting during a meeting and decide among the options. Everyone's encouraged to
chip in. We would love for new students in particular to get involved and
produce some content for a meeting, or even take charge of some meetings
altogether.

\textbf{Note} that even if there's no event happening, we will still meet for the
regular Computer Science Hangout session and the session will be treated as an
informal club meeting.

\newpage

\subsection{Other events}
\label{sec-2-6}

We will also have other fun, social events outside of the weekly informal
meetings and formal events described above. There are ideas flying around that
include but aren't limited to the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item Movie nights
\item Jam sessions
\item Hackathons
\item Game days
\item Fun(d) raising events
\end{itemize}

Read on for details on specific instances of some of these that are planned for
this semester.

Any other ideas are welcome. We also need volunteers to help us organize these
events. If you fancy any of these, or if you have a different event you would
like to lead the club into, get in touch with one of the club officers. In
general, if you want to volunteer for any club events, or want to get involved
in any way, shape or form, don't hesitate to reach out to us.

\section{Linux Workshop}
\label{sec-3}

This Friday, February 5, Ujjwal will be running a linux workshop during the CS club
meeting, i.e., 3 to 5 pm in BUH104.

We will cover basic Linux commands and demonstrate a workflow to write C++
programs that makes working on Dr. Liow's assignments much more fun than
working in Visual Studio does.

This is recommended for any CISS245 and above student who doesn't yet know of
Linux. Interested students from lower classes are nonetheless very welcome.

There will be further Linux workshops covering other workflows and more advanced
topics later on. Especially if there is demand.

\begin{description}
\item[{WHAT:}] Linux Workshop
\item[{WHY:}] Learn a new Operating System that is much more streamlined for programming
\item[{WHEN:}] 3 pm to 5 pm, February 5
\item[{WHERE:}] BUH104
\end{description}

\section{MidwayUSA Visit}
\label{sec-4}

Our department has a strong relationship with the local companies of note. One
of the biggest local companies, MidwayUSA, have a large number of our graduates
working for them. They have invited us to tour their company. We will visit
them either on February 4, February 5 or February 11. 

We will decide the time and date based on how many of us can make it. Please go
to the following link and select all times that work for you if you are
interested in joining us:

\href{http://bit.ly/1m8i0XL}{MidwayUSA Tour Times Survey}

We will decide on a time very soon and send further information out.

\begin{description}
\item[{WHAT:}] MidwayUSA Visit
\item[{WHY:}] Watch professional programmers in action and start building a network
\item[{WHEN:}] February 4, February 5 or February 11; exact time to be decided
\item[{WHERE:}] MidwayUSA, transportation will be provided
\end{description}


\newpage


\section{Movie Night}
\label{sec-5}

We will run a movie night on friday, February 19. The location isn't yet
finalized, and we will send information out in the next week or so.

We will watch one of the all-time classics: Yojimbo by Akira Kurosawa featuring
Toshiro Mifune. The movie is in Japanese so it will be somewhat of a cultural
experience as well. Among other things in it's legacy, Yojimbo was the primary
inspiration for other great movies such as \textquotedblleft{}The Good, the Bad and the
Ugly\textquotedblright{}.

\begin{description}
\item[{WHAT:}] Movie Night featuring Yojimbo by Akira Kurosawa
\item[{WHY:}] Watch a classic movie featuring a renowned actor-director combination
\item[{WHEN:}] 7 pm to 10 pm on February 19
\item[{WHERE:}] To Be Decided
\end{description}


\newpage


\section{Computer Science Jam Session (CS.JS)}
\label{sec-6}

Our annual musical event makes a return this year as well. We will meet at the
Dorsey Chapel between 11:00 am and 12:30 pm on March 10 and show off our
musical abilities and masterpieces. Everyone is encouraged to do something,
even if it's just miming along their favorite song's music video.

\begin{description}
\item[{WHAT:}] Computer Science Jam Session (CS.JS)
\item[{WHY:}] Share your music with others and listen to what others are listening to!
\item[{WHEN:}] 11 am to 12:30 pm on March 10
\item[{WHERE:}] Dorsey Chapel
\end{description}


\newpage


\section{Hackathon}
\label{sec-7}

Take a timeout from academic exercises and develop a complete application (or a
prototype thereof.) Even if you are only starting out with programming, please
participate! You'll get to get a taste of what it's like to work on an actual
project with a team.

We will meet on Saturday, March 19 and take turns proposing ideas that we want
to hack some code for. We will split into groups based on which ideas interest
us the most and then hack away for the remainder of the day. At the end of day,
we will present whatever we got done to everyone. We will then vote to pick the
most well done. We might have actual prizes, but if we don't, there's always
bragging rights.

Any and all tools are fair game as long as they are open source and publicly
available. For this semester, we will keep this open to CC students only.

\begin{description}
\item[{WHAT:}] CC Hackathon
\item[{WHY:}] Share your awesome application idea and hack a prototype in a day
\item[{WHEN:}] 8 am to 9 pm on March 19
\item[{WHERE:}] To be decided
\end{description}

\section{Portal into Computer Science}
\label{sec-8}

Last year, we organized an event we called Portal Into Computer Science (PiCS)
for high school students in the area. We had a trivia challenge focused on CS
and a programming contest for the students with minor prizes. It was a great
success and we are going to do it again this year. We will probably run it
around April.

We need volunteers for the event planning and management. Reach out to one of
the club officers if you are interested in being a part of this.

\begin{description}
\item[{WHAT:}] Portal Into Computer Science (PiCS)
\item[{WHY:}] Help motivate the next generation of Computer Science students and have some fun
\item[{WHEN:}] Around April, exact time and date to be decided
\item[{WHERE:}] To Be Decided
\end{description}


\newpage


\section{Game Day}
\label{sec-9}

Chris and Nate will be organizing a Game Day with the help of volunteers
sometime during the semester. The idea is simply to take a few hours some day
to relax and play video games and board games together. If you are interested
in helping out, reach out to us. 

\begin{description}
\item[{WHAT:}] Game Day
\item[{WHY:}] Hang out, play games
\item[{WHEN:}] To Be Decided
\item[{WHERE:}] To Be Decided
\end{description}

\section{CS T-shirt}
\label{sec-10}

As a tradition, we order t-shirts associated with the club every year. We offer
a very good deal. The price will be around 12 \$ for a short-sleeved t-shirt
based on previous years. Hoodies are also available if you'd like to get them
instead. The proceeds from the sale are used to fund club events. 

This year we will be using a new design that ties the t-shirt with the club
even stronger.

More details will follow. We will probably be collecting money for this
sometime towards the latter half of March.

\begin{description}
\item[{WHAT:}] CS T-shirts
\item[{WHY:}] Wear the club with pride and have a souvenir for later years
\item[{WHEN:}] Middle/Late March
\item[{PRICE}] To Be Decided (\textasciitilde{}\$12)
\end{description}
